Components Basics
- Components are re-usable vue instances with a name.
-Their ppurpose is to encapsulate some functionality of our application.
-They can be buttons, navigation bars custom texts etc.

Creating Components
-Vue components are created with the function 
 
  -> Vue.component()

    -It accepts two parameters
        - The name of the component
        - The option object (this is the same as the options of the vue instance)
        - The el option are absent, this is because components are supposed to be 
          re-usable and hence do not have to mount an html element
    

Eg. 
<body>
    <div id="app" class="container">
        <click-counter></click-counter>
        <click-counter></click-counter>
        <click-counter></click-counter>
    </div>

    <script src="js/vue.js"></script>

    <script>
        Vue.component('click-counter', {
            template: '<button @click="count++">{{ count }}</button>',
            data() {
                return {
                    count: 0
                }
            }
        })
        new Vue({
            el: "#app"
        });
    </script>
</body>

NB. The data option in a component cannot be an object but always a function 
that returns an object.

- Now the component can be used as a regular Html element as above.
- Since components are re-usable, we can create multiple components as above.
- All are new instances of the component and are separate from each other.
